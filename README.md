# Mobile flashcards
This project was developed for Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.

The goal of this project was to develop from scratch a mobile __Android application__, using React Native.

The application allows users to study collections of flashcards: users can create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, and take quizzes on those decks. Additionally, users receive daily notifications if they haven't studied at least one of their decks for the day.

# Installing and launching the project:
